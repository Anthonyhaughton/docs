The issue might be related to the authentication credentials being stored for the old repository URL. When you change the repository name, the URL changes as well, and your Git configuration might still be using the old URL.

To fix this issue, you can update the remote URL in your local Git repository. Follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your local Git repository using the cd command:

cd /path/to/your/local/repo

Use the following command to see the current remote URL:

git remote -v

This will show you the URLs of your remote repositories. You might see something like:

origin  https://github.com/Anthonyhaughton/Python.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Anthonyhaughton/Python.git (push)

Update the remote URL using the git remote set-url command:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Anthonyhaughton/NewRepoName.git

Replace NewRepoName with the actual new name of your repository.

Verify that the remote URL has been updated:

git remote -v
Make sure the URL reflects the changes.

Now try pushing your changes again:

git push origin master

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password, or you might need to use a personal access token if you have two-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account.
